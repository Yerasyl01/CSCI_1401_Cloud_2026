# Product Operating Model Audit: Air Astana
**Date:** January 2026
**Subject:** Assessment of Product Maturity based on Public Disclosures (EGM Reports, Strategy, ESG)
**Framework:** Marty Cagan’s *Product Operating Model* (Silicon Valley Product Group)

## Executive Summary
Based on the analysis of Air Astana’s recent EGM notices (asset acquisition), Sustainability Strategy, and Corporate Strategy, the organization exhibits strong characteristics of a traditional **Industrial/Asset-Manager** Operating Model rather than a **Product Operating Model**.

While they demonstrate competence in *operational/logistical execution* (Safety, Fleet Management, Compliance), they appear to fail the "Product" test in several key dimensions, particularly in how they define value, structure work, and empower teams.

## 1. Mercenary vs. Missionary Teams
**Cagan Principle:** *Mercenaries build what they are told. Missionaries are true believers in the vision and are committed to solving problems for their customers.*

*   **Current State (The "Mercenary" Signals):**
    *   **Focus on Awards & Prestige:** The strategy documentation heavily emphasizes "Skytrax Awards," "Best Airline," and "Five-star ratings." This suggests a culture focused on *external validation* and *vanity metrics* rather than intrinsic customer problem solving.
    *   **Transaction-Centric:** The EGM documents are purely transactional ("Purchase of 5 Boeing 787s"). The language is financial and legalistic, focusing on the *asset* rather than the *customer value* that asset unlocks.
*   **The "Missionary" Glimmer:**
    *   **FlyArystan:** The specific mention of "enabling a large proportion of Kazakh citizens that have never flown domestically before to take to the skies" is a **strong missionary statement**. It speaks to democratizing access (a customer problem). However, the audit question is whether the *teams* are empowered to solve this, or if they are just executing a flight schedule.

**Verdict:** **Predominantly Mercenary.** The culture appears driven by prestige, financial efficiency, and asset accumulation. The "mission" feels like a byproduct of the fleet strategy rather than the driver.

## 2. IT Project Mindset vs. Product Mindset
**Cagan Principle:** *Stop funding projects; start funding product teams. Projects have start/end dates and focus on output. Products are continuous and focus on outcome.*

*   **Current State (The "Project" Trap):**
    *   **"Action Plan" & "Programs":** The ESG strategy is defined as a "comprehensive Strategy for 2023–2032" accompanied by an "Action Plan." This is classic Waterfall planning—locking in a 10-year roadmap of "initiatives" (Outputs) rather than setting targets and letting teams iterate.
    *   **The "Major Transaction":** The business model is driven by massive, discrete capital expenditure events (buying planes). While physical assets *are* discrete projects, the danger is when this "Big Batch" mentality bleeds into their digital and service innovation.
    *   **ESG Compliance:** The sustainability approach is treated as a checklist of "UN SDGs" and "TCFD compliance." A Product Mindset would ask: "How might we create a travel experience where sustainability is a value-add for the passenger?"

**Verdict:** **Fail.** The organization runs on **Projects and Programs**. There is no evidence of "Durable Product Teams" iterating on problems. They "implement initiatives" rather than "solve problems."

## 3. Command & Control vs. Empowered Agencies
**Cagan Principle:** *in good companies, managers lead with context, not control. They give teams problems to solve, not features to build.*

*   **Current State (Top-Down Governance):**
    *   **Board-Level Micro-Management:** The EGM documents show that "Major Transactions" (50%+ of assets) require shareholder votes. While legally required for public companies, this structural constraint creates a **High-Decision Latency** culture. Innovation likely halts while waiting for the "next Board meeting."
    *   **Remuneration Policy:** The focus on "Restated Policy of Remuneration" for the Board typically incentivizes top-down KPI hitting (stock price, EBITDA) rather than customer-centric innovation.
*   **Risk Aversion:** The strict adherence to "Aviation Law" and "Sanctions Policy" necessitates a command-and-control inspection layer (Compliance/Legal). In legacy organizations, this "Department of No" often crushes product experimentation.

**Verdict:** **Command & Control.** The structure is designed for **Reliability and Control**, not **Innovation and Agility**. "Empowerment" is likely limited to execution details, not strategic direction.

## 4. Output vs. Outcome
**Cagan Principle:** *Teams should be judged on business results (Outcomes), not on shipping features or hitting dates (Outputs).*

*   **Current State (Output Obsessed):**
    *   **Fleet Size as Success:** The strategy explicitly highlights "increasing FlyArystan’s fleet to 34 aircraft" as a goal. This is an **Output**.
    *   **Destinations Added:** "Increasing international connections." Another **Output**.
    *   **Net Zero by 2050:** This is an outcome, but it is so far in the future it lacks accountability.
    *   **The Missing Metrics:** There is zero mention of *Product Metrics* such as:
        *   Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)
        *   Digital Conversion Rates
        *   Friction/Time-to-Booking
        *   Personalization success rates
        *   Churn reduction via digital tools

**Verdict:** **Output Focused.** They celebrate *shipping things* (buying planes, opening routes, publishing reports) rather than *changing behavior* (making booking easier, reducing travel anxiety).

## 5. Technology: The "IT Department" vs. Core Compentency
**Cagan Principle:** *In strong product companies, technology is not an expense—it is the business.*

*   **Current State:**
    *   **No Digital Presence:** In all the strategic documents analyzed, the words "Software," "App," "Data," "Algorithm," or "Platform" are virtually absent.
    *   **"Modernising Force":** They mention "embracing new technologies" under the "Efficiency" pillar. This betrays an **IT Mindset**: viewing tech as a way to *cut costs* (efficiency) rather than *create value* (product innovation).
    *   **Outsourced Thinking:** They mention "participating in a research study" with EBRD. A Product company would be running its own experiments.

**Verdict:** **Tech as a Cost Center.** Air Astana views itself as an airline that *uses* technology, not a technology company that *flies planes*. This is the antithesis of the Product Operating Model.

## Conclusion
Air Astana is a successful "Industrial" company operating a **Feature-Factory** model for its services.
*   **They buy assets (Planes) -> They schedule routes (Features) -> They sell tickets (Sales).**

To become **Product-Led**, they would need to invert this:
*   **Identify Customer Pain (Connectivity/Price) -> Empower Teams to Solve it -> Determine if Planes or Digital Tools are the best solution.**

**Biggest Red Flag:** The complete absence of the "Digital Experience" in their core strategy. In 2026, an airline *is* a digital product that happens to have a physical fulfillment component. Treating the "App" as an IT project while the "Planes" get the Board's attention is the classic failure mode of legacy industries.
