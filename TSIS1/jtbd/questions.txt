### The 5 Whys: Digging for Root Cause with Ruslan

**1. The Symptom:**
"Ruslan, why specifically did Finance reject your proposal to hire two freelance developers for a 3-month experiment?"
*(Ruslan's likely answer: "Because I didn't fill out the 10-year 'Asset Depreciation Schedule'.")*

**2. The Classification:**
"Why does the organization require an 'Asset Depreciation Schedule' for a temporary software experiment that might not even exist in 6 months?"
*(Ruslan's likely answer: "Because all software development is classified as 'Capital Expenditure' (CapEx) to boost our balance sheet assets.")*

**3. The Financial Incentive:**
"Why is the company so obsessed with capitalizing every hour of developer time rather than just expensing it as R&D (OpEx) like a tech company?"
*(Ruslan's likely answer: "Because our investor covenants are based on EBITDA and Asset Value. Expensing it would lower our short-term profits.")*

**4. The Cultural Gap:**
"Why hasn't the CTO or Digital Leadership created a separate 'Digital Innovation Pot' to bypass this heavy industrial governance?"
*(Ruslan's likely answer: "Because the Board views IT purely as a support function (Cost Center) to keep planes flying, not as a revenue generator.")*

**5. The Root Cause:**
"Why does the Board fail to see the Mobile App as a revenue generator when it likely processes 50% of your tickets?"
*(Ruslan's likely answer: "Because they are Aviation experts who believe value is created by **buying planes**, and the app is just a digital ticket booth. They trust metal, not code.")*
